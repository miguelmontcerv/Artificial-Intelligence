# Artificial Intelligence
December 3, 2020
The field of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science** has seemed very interesting to me in recent years, having a special place within the field of *computing*, the application of different mathematical concepts and their combination with programming makes it possible to create things surprising.

In this **repository** you will find part of the research that I have carried out on my own in different *forums, pages, courses, videos, etc.* The following are some resources that could be useful, a lot of information in this repository comes from there and other resources have not been verified.
